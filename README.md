drracket-gruvbox
================
Gruvbox based colorscheme for DrRacket.
Shamelessly stolen from [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox/)
Doesn't exactly replicate the original scheme, rather the author decided to 
settle with "looks good for now".

Installation
------------

Directly from github:

  * `raco pkg install git://github.com/rmnull/drracket-gruvbox`

License
-------
